                <h3>Terms of Use</h3>
  
                <p>
                  Welcome to CCH. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at info@winnie.com or Winnie Inc, P.O. Box 641514, San Francisco, CA 94164-1514. These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and CCH, INC. (“Company,” “CCH,” “we” and “us”). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="privacy-content--inner">
                <h3>Will these Terms ever change?</h3>
  
                <p>
                  This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 and children under 13 may not register as users of the Services. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. We do, however, collect information about children from their parents or guardians who are registered users of the Services and we treat such information as “Personal Information” under this Privacy Policy. We ask that our users not provide information about a child without first obtaining consent from that child’s parent or guardian (“Parental Consent”). If we learn we have collected personal information directly from a child under 13 or about a child without Parental Consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information or that information about a child was provided without Parental Consent, please contact us at info@CCH.com.

                <h3>What about my privacy?</h3>
                <h3><small>Information You Provide to Us</small></h3>
  
                <p>
                  We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, children’s birthday(s) and gender, biography, home city, and your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you marketing emails, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If we do email you, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us at info@winnie.com
                </p>

                <h3><small>Information Collected Automatically</small></h3>
                <p>
                  Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which 
                  may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to 
                  access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to 
                  recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able 
                  to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking 
                  advantage of some of our features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear 
                  on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this 
                  Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. 
                  Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those 
                  third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device. We may use this data to customize content for you that 
                  we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users 
                  use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.
                </p>

              <div class="privacy-content--inner">
                <h3>Location Information</h3>
  
                <p>
                  The Services provide location-based information, so in order to work, the Services need to know your location. You will be asked for access to geo-location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system or browser. Whenever you open and use/interact with our apps on your mobile device or go to one of our Sites, we automatically receive and use the precise location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Services to your current location (i.e., we’ll show you a list of nearby places and stories). This information is NOT shared with others. Your real-time location is not shared on the Winnie app. If you write a story, scout, bookmark, like or otherwise provide content, users may infer that you have been to that location. Some content, like stories, may be time stamped and other users could use that information to infer when you were at a place. However, note that stories can be posted when you aren’t at the place featured in your story. Each of your stories using the Services is saved to your “Profile” which allows users to look back at all the locations you have interacted with since you created your Services account. You can delete any or all of your stories from your Profile page in the app.

              <div class="privacy-content--inner">
                <h3>What Are the Basics of Using Childcare Hub?</h3>
                <p>We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone, except as expressly provided below. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>

                <h3><small>Information that’s been de-identified.</small></h3>
                <p>We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p>

                <h3><small>Advertisers:</small></h3>
                <p>We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.</p>

                <h3><small>Affiliated Businesses:</small></h3>
                <p>In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>

                <h3><small>Agents:</small></h3>
                <p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Note that an “agent” may also be considered a “partner” in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the terms of the “Information that’s been de-identified” section in that regard.</p>

                <h3><small>User Profiles and Submissions:</small></h3>
                <p>Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments.</p>

                <h3><small>Business Transfers:</small></h3>
                <p>We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>

                <h3><small>Is Personal Information about me secure?</small></h3>
                <p>You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
